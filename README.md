## How can you use this?

### Setup a wordpress (locally or live) with wpgraphql-plugin

As backend you need to connect a wordpress instance. Use for example DDEV or local for local development.

1. Create `.env.local`, just copy `env.local.example`.
1. Install https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/
1. Add fake data via https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/fakerpress/ e.g. (unfortunately no gutenberg support) or https://artisanthemes.io/sample-content-blocks-gutenberg/ (needs a lot of rework)

#### Develop your frontend with SvelteKit ðŸ§¡

Below are the official SvelteKit instructions for the frontend:

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
